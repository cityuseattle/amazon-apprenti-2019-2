Design Pattern - Clousre
    A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 

    In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 

    In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Benefits
    Closures are very important in asynchronous programming because JavaScript functions are first-class objects that can be passed as arguments to other functions.
 
    Using the closure pattern will help you utilize event-driven programming without the need to pass the scope state to the event handler.
